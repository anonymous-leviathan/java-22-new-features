# **JDK 22: The new features in Java 22**

Java 22 is a recent release of the Java programming language, launched in March 2024. It introduces several new features and improvements, including:

* **Project Panama:** This allows for better integration between Java and native code, improving performance for certain tasks.
* **Improved Developer Productivity:** Features like running code from multiple source files without compilation first make development easier.
* **Other Enhancements:** There are also refinements to the Java language itself, its APIs, and the included development tools.

While not a long-term support release, Java 22 is considered a significant upgrade for developers due to its feature set.
